**Note:** This is for issues with Poltergeist.  If you have a howto type question, please ask on Stack Overflow requested in the README.

**Note:** Poltergeist depends on PhantomJS.  The latest stable version of PhantomJS (2.1.1) only supports up to ES5.  If you are attempting to
use ES5+ features/methods your app may report JS errors or may just silently fail. There is nothing Poltergeist can do about that.  You can either
Transpile and Polyfill to ES5 compatible code, or try the beta version of PhantomJS (2.5.x).
